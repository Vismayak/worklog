# Illinois NRS Dashboard

## Point Source Vector Report Notes

**Introduction**

- A point source is any site of discharge into a waterway, such as a pipe. Point sources are often associated with publicly owned treatment works and industrial wastewater treatment plants.
- This sector is implementing strategies to reduce the nutrient loads.
- Phophorus loads are not as well handled as nitrate-nitrogen loads.
- The data is compiled by the Illinois Association of Wastewater Agencies. National Pollutant DischargeElimination System, NPDES, permit holders are also required to submit monthly discharge data to the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, Illinois EPA.
-  Great improvements aready done, the goal was 25% reduction by 2025, and the sector has already achieved340% reduction in 2022

**Resource Measures**
- Only 11 out of 211 municpal facilities sub,itted resource and outreach data, therefore figures significantly underestimate staff, financial, and outreach measure
- The investment in operations, maintenace, and staff has increased

**Outreach measures** - Continues a lot with even online events during covid

**Progress Across Illinois** - Reducing nutrient losses from the point source sector requires two key strategies: upgrading and optimizing the systems used by wastewater treatment facilities, and utilizing a watershed approach


**TP Reductions**
-  Overestimation of the 2011 baseline loads for some facilities may also contribute to overall total phosphorus load reductions.
- 10 major municipal facilities contribute to 62% of the total phosphorus load
- Many of these facilities will remain in the top 10 simply due to the amount of treated wastewater that they discharge on an annual basis.


Nutrient Assessment Reduction Plans help identify phosphorus input reductions by point source discharges, non-point source discharges, and other measures that major municipal facilities can implement alongside a watershed workgroup. This helps meet watershed-wide criteria for dissolved oxygen, offensive aquatic algae, and offensive aquatic plants.

**Total Nitrogen Load Reductions**

- Illinois EPA incentivized point sources to adopt biological phosphorus removal. This is because the low dissolved-oxygen environment used with biological phosphorus removal would have the additional advantage of reducing a significant fraction of the nitrogen as well.

- The 2021 statewide total nitrogen load from all point sources was estimated to be 76.6 million pounds, which is a 12.2% decrease from the 2011 baseline load (Table 5.7). The 2022 total nitrogen load from all point sources was estimated to be 77.2 million pounds, which is an 11.6% decrease from the 2011 baseline load

**Future Stategic Actions**

Most municipal facilities required to develop a NARP. s wastewater facilities continue to invest in nutrient removal technology, total phosphorus loads — and in some cases, total nitrogen loads — are expected to continue to decrease.
